Add headings (H2-H6) to auto-generate the TOC.

Social share buttons are available on the right sidebar for easy sharing.

Example
<!-- Example of a Pricing Table Block -->
<div class="uc-pricing-table-editor">
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Basic Plan</h3>
    <h4>$9.99/month</h4>
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li>Feature 1</li>
      <li>Feature 2</li>
    </ul>
    <a class="components-rich-text" href="#">Subscribe</a>
  </div>
</div>

Custom Blocks
The theme includes the following custom Gutenberg blocks:

uC-Blockquote: Styled blockquotes with footer and citation support.
uC-Table: Responsive tables with add/remove column buttons.
uC-CTA: Call-to-action cards with gradient backgrounds.
uC-Tabs: Tabbed content with dynamic add/remove tabs.
uC-Steps: Step-by-step guides with numbered indicators.
uC-Pricing-Table: Flexible pricing tables with image and feature lists.

Each block is styled with modern CSS (e.g., gradients, shadows) and includes editor-friendly controls.
Table of Contents
The TOC is dynamically generated from H2-H6 headings in the post content:

Desktop: Displayed in a sticky sidebar with numbered links.
Mobile: Collapsed in a Bootstrap accordion for space efficiency.
Logic: If no headings are present, the TOC div is not rendered (both desktop and mobile).

Example TOC Output
<aside class="table-of-contents">
  <h3>Table of Contents</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="#heading-1">Introduction</a></li>
    <li><a href="#heading-2">Getting Started</a></li>
